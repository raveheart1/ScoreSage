# ScoreSage AI

**ScoreSage AI** is a machine learning-driven platform designed to predict sports outcomes using historical data. The goal of the project is to provide low-risk, high-volume predictions with decent accuracy, allowing users to make informed decisions. The system leverages a variety of Azure services for data ingestion, processing, model training, and deployment.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Automated data ingestion using Azure Data Factory for sports statistics and outcomes.
- **Data Storage**: Secure and scalable data storage with Azure Data Lake or Blob Storage.
- **Model Training**: Machine learning models trained on historical sports data using Azure Machine Learning and Databricks.
- **Prediction Engine**: Real-time or batch sports predictions deployed via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Functions.
- **Automation**: Predictive models are continuously trained and updated based on new data using Azure Data Factory for automation.

## Tech Stack
- **Azure Data Factory**: For data ingestion and orchestration.
- **Azure Data Lake/Blob Storage**: For storing raw and processed sports data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For feature engineering and data processing.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: For model training, evaluation, and management.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** / **Azure Functions**: For deploying the prediction engine.
- **Azure Monitor**: For tracking model performance and usage analytics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Basic understanding of machine learning and Python
- Familiarity with Azure services such as Data Factory, Storage, and Machine Learning

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScoreSage-ai.git
    cd ScoreSage-ai
    ```

2. **Set up your Azure environment**:
    - Create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - Set up your storage account (ADLS or Blob Storage) for storing raw and processed data.
    - Create a Databricks cluster for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
    - Provision an AKS cluster or set up Azure Functions for model deployment.

3. **Configure environment variables**:
    Create an `.env` file in the root directory with your Azure details:
    ```bash
    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<your-storage-account-name>
    AZURE_ML_WORKSPACE=<your-ml-workspace-name>
    ```

### Usage

1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Set up an Azure Data Factory pipeline to ingest historical sports data. You can configure the pipeline to fetch data from APIs or external datasets.
    - Store raw data in Azure Data Lake or Blob Storage.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Use Databricks or Python notebooks to clean and preprocess the data.
    - Perform feature engineering such as calculating averages, streaks, or player/team strength.

3. **Model Training**:
    - Train machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning. Start with basic models like logistic regression, then explore more advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.

4. **Model Deployment**:
    - Deploy the model to AKS or Azure Functions for real-time or batch predictions.
    - Automate the process with Azure Data Factory for periodic model retraining.

5. **Monitoring**:
    - Use Azure Monitor to track prediction accuracy, resource usage, and overall performance.

### Example Code

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example data preprocessing and model training
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]  # Features
y = data['outcome']  # Target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
